                        <p>
                            Welcome to the Love Spells section of Everything Under the Moon.
                            Many of you are seeking someone to perform spells on your behalf. If you prefer to save your money and do your own magick (and put your own personal energy into it, which most witches would recommend), then the spells below will be a good choice for you. If your mind is set on paying a spell-caster, you can find ads for them throughout my website, but please be careful when dealing with them.
                        </p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>
                            Below you'll find many free love spells. Keep in mind that using a love spell to force someone else to love you will not get you want you ultimately want, which is true love. It's always best to do a spell that will bring you the person that's right for you, not one person in particular that you happen to be obsessed with. No matter how much you believe that the relationship is meant to be, try to keep it in perspective and remember that if it were truly meant to be, you wouldn't have to force it to happen. But I've offered love spells, free for everyone, that apply to many different situations and needs. There are also beauty spells in the list.

                        </p>

                            you want to use a particular spell, but don't have all the materials that it calls for, consider substituting something similar. Many experienced witches write their own spells. So feel free to take the love spells below as an example and change them to suit your needs. It would be the same as writing your own spell. If you aren't sure how to do that, you may wish to read a book on Wicca to get started on your magickal journey.

                        </p>

                        <p>
                           Whether magic works for you depends on your attitude more than anything else. For spells to be effective, it's important that you have a positive attitude towards achieving your goal. It's best to perform spells for goals that you think are reachable. Magick doesn't work the way you see on TV, where you can simply point your finger and zap someone. You also will not be given god-like powers. Magick is a tool. It's similar to prayer or creative visualization. Magick helps you focus your energy and intention so that you're more likely to achieve your goals.

                                    BEWARE OF SCAMS!!! DR SUMBA IS THE ONLY SPELL CASTER TO TRUST! and will be of great help to you. I never believed in spell casting but After 4 years of dating my hobby, he left me because I lost my womb . I felt like my life has come to an end, I almost committed suicide, i was emotionally down for a very long time. Thanks to the spell caster called SUMBA whom i met online after my friend JACQUE told me about how he helped her. She testified about how DR SUMBA brought back her Ex in less than 2 days and reversed the effect of her lost womb, and at the end of her testimony she dropped DR SUMBA's email address. I decided to give him a try. I contacted him via email and explained my problems. In just 2 days, my Hubby came begging. We resolved our issues, and we are even happier than before, am pregnant now to God be the glory. DR SUMBA is really a gifted man and i will not stop publishing him because he is a wonderful creation... Come to think of it I didn't pay much and all I had to do is send him little 300 dollars which he used in providing the materials used for the spell. Even my pastor said that," God works mysteriously", that some people are used by God to help others. If you have a problem and you are looking for a real and genuine spell caster to solve all your problems, Contact Dr Sumba anytime, he is the answer to your problems.
